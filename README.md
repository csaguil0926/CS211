# CS211
My Code from Computer Architecture Fall 2021, which includes all the projects except for pa3: Bomb Lab and pa4.

### Pa1
A compilation of short C programs in order to familiarize students with C.

### Pa2
Implements a simple michine learning algoriths.
Uses a 2d array to implement matrices. These matrices are used to find an estimate of house prices based on previous house prices scanned in from a file.

### Pa3
Implements a cache simulator with and without prefetching.
Given the inputs:
- cache size in bytes
- associativity (assoc: n for n-way associative cache or assoc for fully associative cache)
- replacement policy (fifo or lru)
- block size in bytes
- trace file

This program will output the:
- number of cache hits
- number of cache misses
- number of memory reads
- number of memeory writes

observed for both simulated caches.
